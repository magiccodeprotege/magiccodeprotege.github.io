# A New Beginning: Arch Linux 
## My background: My introduction with Linux
My introduction with the Linux operating system started back in the summer of 2018 with Raspberry Pi OS (formerly Raspbian). I was applying for a job and I needed to know how to navigate my way through Linux. In the job description, there were words such as RHEL, Debian, and CentOS, but In my eyes they were only technical jargon. September 2018, I started work and paried up on a computer desktop with a senior programmer. Let me paint a picture, she looked like Carol from the Walking Dead and was a badass python programmer. She knew her stuff and ran circles around everyone in the office. Well, we had needed to store some network traffic into Elasticseach and query one of its endpoints to see if its health status comes back green. It wasn't until the data that we needed to put into Elasticsearch needed to be in a format such as json, so the data excahnege could work nicely. She started typing like a typist from the 80s and bouncing from terminal to vi and back and forth. I knew she was the shit when she would read the man pages to figure out a command's arguments then execute them all without google.com. The way she spoke and I watched her program the shell, it felt like watching a video game. I have to try it for myself....
