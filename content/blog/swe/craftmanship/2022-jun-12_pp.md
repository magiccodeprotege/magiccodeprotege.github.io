#### Early Adapter
- When given something new, I can grasp it quickly and integrate it with the rest of my knowledge

#### Inquisitive
- always asking questions. 

#### Critical Thinker
- I rarely take things as given without first getting to the facts. 

#### Realistic
- I try to understand the underlying nature of each problem.
- Deeply understanding that a process should be difficult or will take a while to complete gives me the stamina to keep at it.
