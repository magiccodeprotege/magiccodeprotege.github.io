# My introduction with Linux
My introduction with Linux started back circa summer of 2018 with the Raspberry 
Pi OS (formerly Raspbian). There I was applying for a job and I needed to know 
how to navigate my way through Linux. In the job description, there were OS
requirements such as RHEL, Debian, and CentOS but In my eyes they were only 
technical jargon. Here comes September 2018, I was hired and brough on a project 
and was paried up with a senior programmer. Let me paint a picture about this 
senior, she looked like Carol from the Walking Dead and was a badass python 
programmer. She knew her stuff and ran circles around everyone in the office. 
Our task was to install Elasticseacrh, store some data in it and graph it with 
through the Kibana dashboard. We started to query one of Elasticsearch's endpoints 
to see if its health status comes back successful. We chose json as the data 
exchange format and we needed to transform the data. She started typing like a 
typist from the 80s, she was bouncing from terminal to vi and back and forth. 
I knew she was the shit when she would read the man pages to figure out a particular
command's arguments and options just so she could then execute them all without 
using google.com. The way this all happened, as I watched her program the shell, 
it felt  like watching a video game. I knew I had to try it for myself....
